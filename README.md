## Inspiration
This project let me to explore and establish resources that I have pendent to aproach.
For the page navigation the css feature scroll-timeline is fun to use and cool to watch.
The SVG pictures and animations are a powerfull tool to no pixel degradation render and save memory; the pics created by code weigh less than .wepp or .jpg files.
As developer with illustration background I want make all icons and pics as a challenge.
